- The Greyhole Admin web UI is available to users who donated (any amount) to the Greyhole project, or to Guillaume Boudreau.  
  Use the `Donate!` button at the top of the web UI, or if you already donated, see the `License` tab in the `Greyhole Config` page.
- Donating will grant you the rights to personally use the web UI for any (reasonable) number of Greyhole installs. Simply enter your email address in the `License` tab of all the installs that __you__ manage. Most often, that means your own install, and maybe those of family & friends.
- Donating does NOT grant you the rights to distribute the web UI in any way.
- Your web UI license is non-transferable.
- You are allowed to use the web UI during initial setup of any number of installs, as instructed in the [USAGE](https://raw.github.com/gboudreau/Greyhole/master/USAGE) file.
- You are allowed to test the web UI for 30-days, beginning when you start using it (which might not necessarily be when you installed Greyhole).
